#We need to report how many enemies are in our,players immediate vicinity - but they want to know what those enemies are! Fix the count_enemies function.
# It accepts as input:
#enemy_names: a list of strings
#It should return a dictionary where:
#The keys are all the enemy names from the list
#The values are the number of how many times each enemy appeared in the list
#Run the code in its current state. It will raise a KeyError.
#Fix the code by checking if a key is in the dictionary before trying to update its value. If it isn't, set it to 1.
